# Html_Basics
This repository is created for two reasons, one to attempt pushing something to Github and two as the first assignment for a Java Immersion Class offered by Tech Talent South. It contains four files:  
 
  - basics.html
  - travel.html
  - restaurants.html
  - resume.html

These four files are my first attempts at coding in html.
